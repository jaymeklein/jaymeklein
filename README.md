### Jayme Klein :snake:
I'm a passionate full-stack software developer with 3 years of experience and a deep love for Python. I enjoy building innovative solutions, whether by creating new projects from scratch or contributing to existing open-source initiatives

In addition to my development skills, I’m committed to making software more accessible by contributing to translations.

My interest in technology began at the age of 7, which eventually led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science at a Brazilian federal institution and transition into a full-time software development career. <br>
