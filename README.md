### Jayme Klein :snake:
I'm a passionate full-stack software developer with a deep love for Python. I enjoy building innovative solutions, whether by creating new projects from scratch or contributing to existing open-source initiatives. With a focus on both front-end and back-end development, I have experience working with Angular, AngularJS and Flask.

In addition to my development skills, Iâ€™m committed to making software more accessible by contributing to translations.

My interest in technology began at the age of 7, which eventually led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science at a Brazilian federal institution and transition into a full-time software development career.
